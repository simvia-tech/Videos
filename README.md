### [Perform a basic mechanical study with salome_meca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjUMgDSKJjY)
In this video, you will learn the fundamentals of a standard mechanical study in salome_meca: 

-- Create the geometry and groups with the sketch module.
-- Create a mesh for the geometry.
-- Read the mesh with Aster_Study and set up the model using the "isotropic linear elastic" assistant.
-- Run the simulation.
-- Visualize the results with post-processing tools.

### [Behind the scenes of salome_meca: scripting and files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Tcn4K-XGQ)
This video is a direct continuation of "[Learn & Understand] Perform a basic mechanical study with salome_meca." If you haven't seen it yet, you can watch it here: [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjUMgDSKJjY) 

In this video, we focus on the powerful Python scripting capabilities within salome_meca. We explain how to work with the dump file from the previous study, provide a complete overview of the generated files, their functions, and demonstrate how to use them to compile code_aster directly from the bash.
