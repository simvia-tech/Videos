# Tutorial on Von Karman vortices - Part 1 : mesh and geometry on Salome

## Introduction

This video is a direct follow-up to the previous one on how to install code_saturne with docker.
If you haven't watched it already a link is there ([link](https://youtu.be/toaXeW8Wt94)).

We are now going to use this docker installation of code_saturne to showcase a basic Von Karman
Vortex study. We'll first use a docker image of salome to create the geometry and the mesh then
move in the code_saturne docker and run the study. Finally we'll
postprocess the results on paravis. In this first part of the tutorial, we focus solely on the 
geometry and mesh creation on salome.

## Creating a geometry with GEOM

### Simple quasi 2d plate

For this video we're going to go into the geometry module. For the sake of providing examples, we will create a quasi 2d plate (a thin rectangle), and refine the mesh using the submeshes feature. 

We'll start by creating a rectangle using the rectangle button `[0:43s]`. As this will be quasi 2d, we don't really care about the dimension along Z so we put it to 0.1. The other two dimensions are going to be 2.2 and 0.41. Let's apply and close.

### Small tips on Salome `[1:04-1:18]`

Now we don't really see the box so let's zoom a little bit. To do this, you can press control and left click. Similarly, if you want to rotate you can press control and right click. Finally, control and middle click will allow you to span in the 2D plane the picture.

### Hole `[1:20-2:10]`

Now we are going to generate a cylinder that will act as our main obstacle `[1:25]`. As a radius we'll put 0.05.
We don't care about the height as it's going to be 2d at the end of the (set it to 1). Let's now apply a translation of (Dx=0.2, DY=0.2, DZ=0) to put it in the middle of the plate `[1:38]`. Now we're going to perform a cut with
the cut tool button `[1:48]`. We'll select as the main object the box that is going to be the flow and as a tool
object the translated cylinder. You should see the cylinder disappeared and a hole in the plate where the cylinder was before `[2:04]`.

### Partitioning the geometry `[2:17-5:41]`

In order to make things easier for the meshing algorithm we're going to intersect this flow with some planes (see the meshing section as for the why we do this).

Let us start by creating 2 points. The first point called vertex_1 is going to be at (X=0.201, Y=0.201, Z=0.1) which corresponds roughly to the center of the obstacle `[2:28]`. The second point called vertex_2 is going to be at the following coordinates: (X=0.41, Y=0, Z=0.1) `[2:52]`. This point is placed here so that we can build a square centered on the hole.

Now let's create the planes with the "create a plane" button `[3:00]`. As a first plane you're going to select
the point in the middle of the obstacle (vertex_1) and a vector along y. It will create you a plane in the (x,z) plane intersecting vertex_1. You can reduce it size to 5 for instance, but make sure this plan is cutting the full plate in two parts `[3:25]`.
The second plane is also going to go through the center of the hole (vertex_1) but this time it's going to be orthogonal to the x axis. We don't need it to be so big again so you can set its size to 5 again, this should be enough to cut the full plate `[3:44]`. 
The third plane is going to go through vertex_2 and be orthogonal to the X axis, effectively cutting the plate as a square centered around the hole, and the rest of the rectangle `[3:58]`.

Let us finally create the two planes along the diagonal of the square centered on the hole. To do this, we're going to generate planes with three points. As the first point we're going to select vertex_1 again but now as a second and third points we are selecting the two points on the edges of the plate `[4:14]`. Finally do the same on the other diagonal of the rectangle there `[4:34]`.

The final product will look messy but if you're looking at it from a top view by clicking on the "view along the (x,y) plane button `[4:49]`, the planes should create a square centered on the hole and cut along its two diagonals `[4:52]`. 

Let's finally make the partition of the flow. Go to the partition tool button `[4:59]` and select as the object the cut (holed plate) and as a tool objects select all of the planes we just created. Now you can see that the geometry for the flow has been cut by the planes we created `[5:20]`. 

Before moving to the meshing algorithm we're going to create some geometric groups go in the menu. Rename the partition as flow as this is going to be the geometry of the flow.


## Creating the geometry groups with GEOM `[5:35-8:51]`

### Surface groups

Right click on the final geometry you just renamed flow, and select "create group". We are going
to create several groups. Let's start with the inlet: this is where the water is going to come inside the mesh.
Select a surface group `[5:38]` and call it "Inlet". Select the two faces on the side of the rectangle close to the hole `[5:49]`. You can select several faces at once by pressing shift and left click (and you can still rotate, zoom and span the interface using ctrl and the mouse buttons). Once you have selected the two faces composing the inlet, press add and click on apply to create the group without closing the create group pannel `[5:54]`. Similarly we are going to create an outlet: this is where the water is going to leave the mesh after it flowed. Name the new group "Outlet" and rotate the structure to select the two faces on the opposite side of the inlet, add them and press apply `[6:10]`.

Now we're going to create the symmetry groups: as the geometry is quasi 2D we don't really care about the faces orthogonal to the z-axis so we're going to define them in Code_Saturne as symmetries. Call the group "Symmetry" and add all of the faces orthogonal to Z `[6:25-6:52]`. If everything was done as in the video you should get 20 faces. If you did any mistakes like in the video, you can right-click on the group and go in edit group. Then you can add the faces that you forgot to put `[6:58]`. Finally, we're going to create a last surface group that is going to be the walls of the flow. Select the sides (you should have six faces), and do not forget to add the obstacle `[7:16-7:38]`. 

### Linear groups

Lastly, we're going to create a 1D group made of all of the vertices that are along the z-axis. Let's name it Z vertices. This group is going to be useful when we'll be doing the mesh (cf later) `[7:40-7:56]`. Do likewise for the x-axis `[7:57-8:13]`.
 
At the end of the day you should have the following groups: the inlet, the outlet, the symmetry that are basically the planes orthogonal to Z and finally the walls (lateral side + obstacle). And of course the 1D Z and X vertices group we just created `[8:20-8:44]`.

## Creating a butterfly mesh with the MESH module `[8:49-9:54]`

Now let's move to the mesh module. We start by expanding the menu of flow, the geometry we just created, and we are going to select it and click on the create mesh button `[8:52]`. The create mesh pannel should open, automatically selecting flow as a geometry. 

As a 3D algorithm we're going to select the hexahedron (i,j,k) algorithm. Hexahedral mesh tends to perform better on turbulent CFD studies and should be used as much as possible.

Then we'll move on to 2D and impose the quadrangle mapping algorithm so that we have quadrilateral elements on the surface.
We create a new hypothesis quadrangle parameter and select "quadrangle preferences". This asks the 2D algorithm to put as many quadrilateral elements as possible close to a transition where the domain's geometry doesnâ€™t allow for a uniform quadrilateral mesh or a where smooth transition is needed to prevent large distortion of mesh elements `[9:12]`.

Move into 1D and we're going to impose a wire discretization algorithm with the hypothesis "number of segments" set to 30. This means that along each vertices of the mesh there will be 30 equidistants segments `[9:20]`.

At this stage if you right click on the mesh you just created and go on compute you're going to see that you have a much
finer mesh around the hole than elsewhere `[9:44]`. Second thing you'll notice is in 3D along the z-axis you have much more elements than what you want. We need only one element along Z `[9:49]`.

## Refining the mesh by adding sub-meshes `[9:54-11:10]`

We are now going to create sub meshes to solve these issues. Right click on the mesh you just created and go on create submesh `[9:50]`.
Here we'll select the Z edges geometry group and impose a new 1D wire discretization algorithm. Go into hypothesis
and create a new number of segment hypothesis and this time you can set it to one `[10:10]`. This way, we'll impose only one
element along the z-axis. You can clear and compute the mesh and as you can see now there is only one cell along the
Z axis `[10:21]`. 

The mesh remains not enough refined passed the hole, close to the outlet. Therefore, let's make a final mesh on this side using the x_vertices group created earlier. Add another wire discretization algorithm and another set of hypothesis number of segments and put 160 segments `[10:41]`. If we compute again the mesh we see that we have a finer mesh everywhere `[10:56]` ! So butterfly meshing is not only necessary for the hexahedral algorithm (otherwise it won't be able to generate the mesh due to the irregularities caused by the hole), but it is also great a way of locally refining the mesh using the several small and local parts of the geometries we created.

## Exporting the mesh as a .MED file `[11:08]`

Finally once we are done we can export the mesh by right clicking it and go into export med file and here you can save
it wherever you want. It's going to be called it Mesh_1 for the next video. Save.
