### [Behind the scenes of salome_meca: scripting and files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Tcn4K-XGQ)
This video is a direct continuation of "[Learn & Understand] Perform a basic mechanical study with salome_meca." If you haven't seen it yet, you can watch it here: [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjUMgDSKJjY) 

In this video, we focus on the powerful Python scripting capabilities within salome_meca. We explain how to work with the dump file from the previous study, provide a complete overview of the generated files, their functions, and demonstrate how to use them to compile code_aster directly from the bash.

### [Von Karman vortices Part 1 - Mesh & Geometry on Salome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh26NeNrjn4)
In this two-part tutorial, we showcase the powerful capabilities of Salome and Code_Saturne by demonstrating their performance on the well-documented Von Karman vortex phenomenon.

In Part 1, we guide you step-by-step through the creation of geometry and mesh, highlighting key tips and tricks in the Geom and Mesh modules. You'll also learn how easy it is to get started with the Docker version of Code_Saturne, which offers impressive performance with minimal installation effort..

### [Open_Telemac river flooding tutorial - Part 1: First steps with QGIS & Q4TS](https://youtu.be/NFo-HavVz70)

This video is the first part of a tutorial on how to simulate river flooding using Open_Telemac.
In this initial video, we focus on creating the model and preparing the data. Using the Q4TS plugin in QGIS, we create a mesh for a domain that we draw directly on the map. We use a French river as an example, but the steps described here can be applied to any river in the world, provided topographic data is available.

Once the mesh is generated, we project the topographic data onto it (specifically, the "bottom" variable). This forms the foundation of the data required for the Open_Telemac model to run a flood simulation.

- Softwares: [Open_Telemac](http://www.opentelemac.com/), [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), [Q4TS](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/q4ts/)
